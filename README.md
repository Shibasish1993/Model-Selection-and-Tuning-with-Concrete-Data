# Model-Selection-and-Tuning-with-Concrete-Data
This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressor to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance. For more details please follow README file.
